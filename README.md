# ATP Schemas

Contains extended schemas, examples, and validators for the ATP protocol.

This application consists of 3 parts:
1. The schemas themselves, under the XSD directory
2. An example validator and schema validator, both which are run by executing the specs.

The root schema containing all customizations for all clients is now `exchange/SBM.xsd`.
